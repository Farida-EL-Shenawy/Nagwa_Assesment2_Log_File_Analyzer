# üìä Log File Analyzer
A powerful and efficient Python command-line tool designed to parse and analyze web server log files. This script provides DevOps and engineering teams with a high-level summary of web traffic, identifies potential issues, and generates actionable reports.


## ‚ú® Key Features
Efficient Parsing: Uses a pre-compiled regular expression to quickly and accurately parse standard Apache/Nginx log formats.

Comprehensive Statistics: Generates key metrics including:

Total Request Count

Status Code Breakdown (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx)

Top 5 Most Active IP Addresses

Top 5 Most Requested Endpoints

Intelligent Issue Detection: Automatically flags potential problems like High Error Rates and Suspicious IP Activity.

Dual Reporting: Outputs a beautifully formatted summary to the console and a structured report to a JSON file.

# ‚≠ê Bonus Feature: IP Geolocation
To provide deeper, more actionable insights, this tool includes a valuable bonus feature:

Geographical Context: For every IP address flagged as "suspicious," the script makes a live API call to geolocate it. The report then includes the IP's city and country, helping teams to quickly identify the origin of unusual traffic patterns (e.g., "Location: Mountain View, United States").

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.13

Core Libraries: re (for Regex), json, datetime

External Packages: requests (for the IP Geolocation bonus feature)
